You give me trauma
You give me more than I can bare
I rise above you
I'll burn my body on the fire
Give me trauma

There's a chain of scenes that repeat in my dreams
In the dark my power overflows
Do you crawl to your church
Do you need something else
Like a meaning beyond this world

You're not a mirror to me
You're not a mirror at all
You're not a mirror to me
You're not a mirror at all
I know you

You give me trauma
You give me more than I can bare
I rise above you
I'll burn my body on the fire
Give me trauma

Breathing deeper now
I am free from the crowd
I'm as clean as the shame will allow
In your fading hour you belong to me now
Twist the spine till it brings you calm

You're not a mirror to me
You're not a mirror at all
You're not a mirror to me
You're not a mirror at all
I'm the sun, the rain
I'm not for you
I'm always apart
I flow through you
I could crash through you
I know you

You give me trauma
You give me more than I can bare
I rise above you
I'll burn my body on the fire
Give me trauma

Just my words repeat
I don't need you to see
I'm beyond good and evil today
I'm a force to fear, you're a void to be killed
Now there's nothing to keep me here
