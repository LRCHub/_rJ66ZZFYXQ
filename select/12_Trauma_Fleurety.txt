There exist so many funny trauma
People carry them wherever they go
Mine are too big and will not let me sleep
Some have many millions,
But they are fewer in numbers
Trauma are bloody, trauma are black

Some have trauma drenched in semen
Trauma are grey, trauma are white
Some have trauma caused by their moms
There exist so many funny trauma

Some nurture their trauma like a cat or dog
Traumatizing experiences shake the foundations
Some experience flashbacks of nightmares
Some suffer from hypervigilance
Or increased static response
There exist so many funny trauma
Depression, anxiety and dissociation
Shrinkage in the hippocampus
Compassion fatigue and burnout
Out
